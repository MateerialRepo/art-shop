# Getting Started with the project

Please Create a clone of the project and run "npm install".
Once it is completed, you can run "npm start" to start the application.

## Things I did

    - Fetched and listed the products from the art shop
    - Created a component for each product card showing the image, name, and price
    - Created a component to list the products
    - Added pagination to the list of products

## Things I would do with more time

    - I would like to add a few more features to the project.
    - Add a single Product view with the react router to show the description of the product.
    - The decision no to add a description to the product list was due to aesthetic reasons.
    - Add tests for the functions in the Product list - Add a search feature to the product list
    - Make the search box filter through the products to list only the products that match the search term.
